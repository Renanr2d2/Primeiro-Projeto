            Hi, my name is Peter Parker, but you can call me Parker.
            A few years ago I was bitten by a radioactive spider that altered my DNA and gave me incredible abilities.
          </p>
          <p> 
            Abilities such as superhuman strength,
            agility, and speed
            amplified, heightened reflexes and senses, and the ability to climb walls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I use these skills to do good and protect those in need, because one day, someone told me that with great power comes great responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            So that's me, the neighborhood buddy.
